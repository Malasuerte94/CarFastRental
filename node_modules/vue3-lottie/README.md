`vue3-lottie` was created to help developers add Lottie animations to their Vue 3 applications. In my search for a simple way to add Lottie animations to my Vue application I found a suprising lack of maintained solutions. `vue3-lottie` is a vue wrapper around the `lottie-web` library with a few additional features.

## Demos

View the live demos here: [https://vue3-lottie.vercel.app](https://vue3-lottie.vercel.app)

## Upgrade to v2.x

If you are using version 1.x of `vue3-lottie` you should upgrade to version 2.x. You can do this by running the [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-usage) command below. This adds TS support for the component. There are some new imports so take a look at the [new documentation](https://vue3-lottie.vercel.app).

## Installation and Usage

### Vue 3

- You can install `vue3-lottie` over `yarn` or `npm`. `lottie-web` is a dependency of `vue3-lottie` and should be automatically installed when you install `vue3-lottie`.

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-lottie@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-lottie@latest
```

- Register the component in your Vue 3 application.

The most common use case is to register the component globally.

```js
// main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import Vue3Lottie from 'vue3-lottie'
import 'vue3-lottie/dist/style.css'

createApp(App).use(Vue3Lottie).mount('#app')
```

If you get an error with TS, try `use(Vue3Lottie, { name: "Vue3Lottie" })`

To define global components for [Volar type-checking](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/tree/master/extensions/vscode-vue-language-features#usage) you will need to add:

```ts
// components.d.ts
declare module '@vue/runtime-core' {
  export interface GlobalComponents {
    LottieAnimation: typeof import('vue3-lottie')['Vue3Lottie']
  }
}
export {}
```

If needed rename component to use:

```ts
app.use(Vue3Lottie, { name: 'LottieAnimation' }) // use in template <LottieAnimation />
```

- `name` string (default: 'Vue3Lottie') - set custom component name

Alternatively you can also import the component locally.

```js
import { Vue3Lottie } from 'vue3-lottie'
import 'vue3-lottie/dist/style.css'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Lottie,
  },
}
```

You can then use the component in your template

```vue
<template>
  <Vue3Lottie :animationData="AstronautJSON" :height="200" :width="200" />
</template>

<script>
import { Vue3Lottie } from 'vue3-lottie'
import 'vue3-lottie/dist/style.css'

import AstronautJSON from './astronaut.json'

export default {
  components: {
    Vue3Lottie,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      AstronautJSON,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

### Nuxt 3

This is still experimental. Will be updated soon.

- You can install `vue3-lottie` over `yarn` or `npm`. `lottie-web` is a dependency of `vue3-lottie` and should be automatically installed when you install `vue3-lottie`.

If you are using npm:

```shell
npm install vue3-lottie@latest --save
```

If you are using yarn:

```shell
yarn add vue3-lottie@latest
```

- Create a folder called **`plugins`** at the root of your project.
- Create a file named **`Vue3Lottie.client.ts`** inside the _plugins_ directory.
- Add the following code to the **`Vue3Lottie.client.ts`** file.

```ts
import Vue3Lottie from 'vue3-lottie'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(Vue3Lottie)
})
```

If you get an error with TS, try `use(Vue3Lottie, { name: "Vue3Lottie" })`

This should register as a global component that you can call anywhere in your app under the <Vue3Lottie> tag.

I would recommend using a `<client-only>` parent tag to ensure that the animation only loads in on the client side.

```vue
<client-only>
  <Vue3Lottie
    animationLink="https://assets10.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_soCRuE.json"
    :height="200"
    :width="200"
  />
</client-only>
```

- Import the css file required by the component into your **`app.vue`** file.

```js
import 'vue3-lottie/dist/style.css'
```

## Events

A few events are emitted from the component. Look at the [Demos](#demos) for examples.

- onComplete
  - If your animation has a finite amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed.
- onLoopComplete
  - If your animation has a finite amount of loops you can use this event to know when the animation has completed a loop.
- onEnterFrame
  - This event is fired every frame of the animation. There will be 60 events fired per second if your lottie animation runs at 60fps.
- onSegmentStart
  - This event is fired when the animation enters a segment.
- onAnimationLoaded
  - This event is fired when the animation has loaded. This should let you know when you can start referencing the methods for the component.

## Methods

You can control the animation with the following methods. These methods can be called by assigning a `ref` value to the `vue3-lottie` component. Look at the [Demos](#demos) for examples.

- play
  - Plays the animation
- pause
  - Pauses the animation
- stop
  - Stops the animation. This will also reset the animation to the first frame. Look at the demo for some examples.
- destroy
  - You can call this method to destroy the animation. It will remove the animation from the DOM.
- setSpeed(speed)
  - You can call this method to change the speed of your animation.
- setDirection(direction)
  - You can call this method to change the direction of your animation.
- getDuration(inFrames)
  - You can call this method to get the duration of your animation.
- goToAndStop(frameNumber, isFrames)
  - You can call this method to go to a specific frame of your animation. The animation will be stopped at the end of this call.
- goToAndPlay(frameNumber, isFrames)
  - You can call this method to go to a specific frame of your animation. The animation will be played from this frame.
- playSegments(segments, forceFlag)
  - You can call this method to play a specific segment of your animation.
- setSubFrame(subFrame)
  - You can call this method to set the subframe value.
- updateDocumentData(documentData, index)
  - This method updates text on text layers. Refer to the [official docs](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/wiki/TextLayer.updateDocumentData) for how to use this method.
